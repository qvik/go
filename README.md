# Qvik's Golang Library

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/qvik/gokit?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/qvik/gokit)

This is [Qvik's](https://qvik.com) Golang kit. It aims to collect all the usual boring boiler plate code from projects into one place. It is not meant to be a framework or a specific library but more in the way of being scaffolding for new projects.

See the godoc documentation for the library contents.

## Usage

Install the library like so:

```sh
go get -u "github.com/qvik/gokit"
```

## License

The library is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcomed. General guidelines for contributions:

* Before submitting a merge request, consider whether your code is solving something that is not already provided by an existing, well-tested library
* Your code must pass through `gofmt+golint` with no issues.
* Avoid long lines; keep your code lines under 80 characters in length
* Write tests for your code
